# Optimum Gravatar Cache
WordPress **Optimum Gravatar Cache** has been written by José Miguel Silva Caldeira <miguel@ncdc.pt>.

## Description:
WordPress **Optimum Gravatar Cache** is a plugin for allowing you to cache the gravatars locally. In this way it is possible to use the gravatars in a more efficient way.

The plugin intends the following:
* Work with the gravatars locally, cache;
* Reduce the number of requests per page, thus reducing the total time required to load all files. This is achieved because most users do not have a custom gravatar, and for these only a file needs to be downloaded;
* Optimize all gravatars by reducing their size and again the transfer time.

These are for now the strengths.

## Settings
Below we can see the ScreenShot of the plugin configuration page.
