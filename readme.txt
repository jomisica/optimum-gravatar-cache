It cache the gravatars locally, reducing the total number of requests per post. This will speed up the loading of the site and consequently improve the user experience.

== Description ==

WordPress **Optimum Gravatar Cache** is a plugin for allowing you to cache the gravatars locally. In this way it is possible to use the gravatars in a more efficient way.

The plugin intends the following:
* Work with the gravatars locally, cache;
* Reduce the number of requests per page, thus reducing the total time required to load all files. This is achieved because most users do not have a custom gravatar, and for these only a file needs to be downloaded;
* Optimize all gravatars by reducing their size and again the transfer time.

These are for now the strengths.

The plugin is able to use the WordPress gravatars as well as the BuddyPress plugin gravatars.
